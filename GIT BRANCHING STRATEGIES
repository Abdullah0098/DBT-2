GIT BRANCHING STRATEGIES:

1.    Master Branch: The master branch is like the main version of your project that is ready for release.
It contains the stable and tested code that is used in the production environment.
  
2.    Integration Branch: The integration branch is where different changes from developers or teams come together. 
It ensures that all the code changes work well together before being merged into the master branch. Continuous Integration (CI) tools help automate the process
 of merging and testing these changes.
      
3.    Staging Branch: The staging branch acts as a staging area for final testing. It provides a separate environment where the integrated changes can be thoroughly tested, 
allowing Quality Assurance (QA) teams to check if everything works as expected before releasing it to the production environment.
      
4.    Dev/Deploy Branch: The dev/deploy branch is where active development takes place. Developers create separate branches off this branch to work on specific features or fixes.
Once the changes are completed and tested, they are merged back into the dev/deploy branch. 
Continuous Deployment (CD) tools automate the process of deploying the changes from the dev/deploy branch to the staging or production environment.
  
The CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process involves using automated tools and practices to integrate code changes frequently,
run tests, and deploy the software to different environments. QA teams play a crucial role in testing the changes in the staging branch to ensure high-quality software
before it goes into production, which is the live environment where end-users can access and use the software.

GIT BRANCHING STRATEGIES SEQUENCE OF STEPS:
1.	Developers create separate feature branches off the dev/deploy branch to work on specific features or fixes.
These branches are usually short-lived and dedicated to a single task.

2.	Once the development is complete, developers merge their feature branches back into the dev/deploy branch.
This helps consolidate the changes from different developers or teams into one central branch.

3.	The CI/CD process is triggered when changes are merged into the dev/deploy branch.
Continuous Integration (CI) tools automatically build and test the code to ensure it meets quality standards. This helps catch any integration issues or conflicts early on.

4.	If the CI tests are successful, the changes are then merged into the integration branch.
This branch serves as a central point where all changes come together. It allows for further integration testing and ensures that all the code changes work well together.

5.	After successful integration testing, the changes are merged into the staging branch.
This provides a separate environment where QA teams can thoroughly test the integrated changes and perform additional quality assurance checks.
They ensure that the software functions correctly and meets the desired quality standards before moving forward.

6.	Once the changes are approved in the staging branch, they are merged into the master branch. The master branch represents the stable and production-ready code.
The changes are now ready for deployment to the production environment.

7.	Continuous Deployment (CD) tools are triggered when changes are merged into the master branch.
These tools automate the process of deploying the changes to the production environment, making the updated software available to end-users.
This sequence ensures a controlled and structured workflow, with thorough testing and quality checks at each stage before moving changes into production.
It allows for collaboration, integration testing, and quality assurance, reducing the risk of introducing errors or issues into the production environment.
